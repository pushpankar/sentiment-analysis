In this project, I have compared recurrent neural network, convolutional neural
network and Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis task. I have compared them using
accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.


Following libraries are required:
1. Numpy  
2. NLTK  
3. BeautifulSoup  
4. Pandas  
5. Sklearn  
6. Keras  

Full report of this research is in [report.pdf](../master/Capstone-report.pdf)  
I am using IMDB movie review [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/data)
